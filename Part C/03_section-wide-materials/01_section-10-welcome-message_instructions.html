  There are really two mostly-separate parts to this last module: The final "new material" on subtyping and then the "final exam" to revisit key concepts for Parts B &amp;C.
 </p>
 <p>
  Subtyping makes for an excellent last topic in the course.  It brings us back to considering static typing one last time, it is essential for understanding statically typed object-oriented languages, and contrasting subtyping with the polymorphic types (generics) of ML provides another opportunity to understand two things better by considering their relative strengths.  We even finish by considering how subtyping and generics can be combined in a synergistic way, bringing us to the concept of bounded polymorphism.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because none of ML, Racket, or Ruby has a static type system with support for subtyping, this module will stay at a "conceptual level", using pseudocode and (optionally) Java examples to convey the key ideas.  While it can be more challenging to understand programming-languages topics without the opportunity to try them out by writing and running programs, this in itself makes for a nice final challenge at the end of our studies.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no programming assignment this week (as a pretty direct consequence of the previous paragraph).  Instead, there is a final exam, much like there was an exam at the end of Part A.  This second exam covers Part B and Part C, which is a great way to tie together ideas from Part B and Part C, particularly those that are not well covered by the programming assignments.  Prior to the final exam is a reading providing more details about the exam, as well as a practice exam.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then we will say good-bye and share a few final thoughts and a well-earned congratulations!!
