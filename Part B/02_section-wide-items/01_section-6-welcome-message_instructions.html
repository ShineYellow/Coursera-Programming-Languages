  The material in this module has two parts that fit together nicely:
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  First, we will study how we can build interesting data structures in Racket.  Because Racket is dynamically typed, we could just "use cons cells for everything," but doing so is error-prone and does not work well when you want abstraction and modularity.  On the other hand, a feature like ML's $$\verb|datatype|$$ bindings does not make much sense "as is" in a dynamically typed language.  So we will learn about Racket's
  <em>
   structs
  </em>
  and how to use them for building data structures.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, we will learn how we can write a program in one programming language that is an
  <em>
   implementation of another programming language
  </em>
  .  After some general material on the difference between
  <em>
   compilers
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   interpreters
  </em>
  and how to represent programs as syntax
  <em>
   trees
  </em>
  , we will focus in particular on implementing a language via an interpreter that is "just" a recursive function over a tree.  The core challenge in this module's homework assignment is to implement just such an interpreter in Racket for a small "made-up" programming language that has first-class function closures.  (We will describe how to implement closures and then you will translate the ideas into Racket in your interpreter.)
 </p>

  Compared to previous modules, this module has less [video] content but a more challenging and rewarding homework.  Enjoy!
