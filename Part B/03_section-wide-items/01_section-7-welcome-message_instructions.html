  We now leverage our experience using (and implementing!) a dynamically typed language as well as our experience in Part A using a statically typed language to discuss what static type systems are, what it means for them to be correct, what advantages they have, and what disadvantages they have. Because "is static or dynamic better?" is a worn-out argument in software development, we will focus on defining the relevant questions carefully and then presenting various advantages and disadvantages -- which you can then "weight" yourself to reach your own perspective on the matter.  Instead of a programming assignment, we will end this module -- and Part B -- with a short quiz containing some interesting questions related to this module's content.
 </p>
 <p>
  The material in this module is essential for understanding any programming language and its design choices related to a type system or lack thereof.  The material will prove very useful in Part C when we study a dynamically typed object-oriented language.

 <p>
  Enjoy!  (And don't miss a final wrap-up video at the end of the module after the quiz.)
