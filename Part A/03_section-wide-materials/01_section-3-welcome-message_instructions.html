  This module of the course is almost entirely about the important topic of first-class functions and function closures.  We hope you will find it elegant, powerful, and challenging.  While the content is, of course, new, the format of this section is similar to the previous two, so we think you will find it familiar in that way by this point in the course.

  We will start with the basics of passing and returning functions from other functions and learn some syntax for defining functions without $$\verb|fun|$$ bindings.   We will see two of the most common such functions -- map and filter -- one of which is actually in our course logo, and we will see the relationship between first-class functions and polymorphic types.  We will then focus on
  <em>
   lexical scope
  </em>
  , the key aspect of the
  <em>
   semantics
  </em>
  of a function that uses variables defined outside the function itself.  We will then study several
  <em>
   idioms
  </em>
  using first-class functions that demonstrate their usefulness.
 </p>

  In this module's homework assignment, it should be no surprise that you will define and use various functions that take other functions.   In addition, you will write some functions that performs computations analogous to what an implementation of a language like ML has to do to implement pattern matching.

  This week's material also has a "lesson" giving course motivation (for the entire course, Parts A, B, and C).  We delayed this material so that it could meaningfully refer to features like pattern matching, first-class functions, and immutable data -- the terminology and experience we need to better understand the course motivation.  It is optional in the sense that it is not need for the assignments or exams, but we think it will be valuable for motivating all your hard work in the course -- and for explaining some of the context and design decisions behind the course.  Please do take the time to watch these few additional videos -- either before or after completing Homework 3.  We think of it as an essential part of the "whole story" even though it is optional.
