  Welcome to the first "real" module of the course.  We know it is large and may therefore be intimidating at first, but everything is carefully ordered to build up a foundation one step at a time.  Because the language, environment, and terminology are likely new to you (that's why you're taking the course!), this first week may feel particularly disorienting.  Fortunately, all of "Part A" of the course uses the same environment, so while future modules certainly bring many new challenges, they will feel more comfortable as you continue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because the introductory material from "Week 1" doesn't have a real homework and because "Week 2" requires getting used to so many new things, we recommend you start this "Week 2" material before the end of "Week 1".
 </p>
 <p>
  This module purposely starts with very simple programs that will likely look strange to you: nothing but "variables", "numbers", and "conditionals".  We focus on "scope" and "shadowing" before building on these concepts with "functions".  We then use "pairs" and "lists" as two complementary ways to build compound data.  Next we consider "let expressions" for "local bindings", including "nested functions" and the importance of bindings for efficiency.  We finish with a couple other specific language features used in the homeworks -- "options" and "booleans" and then some more general perspective on the benefits of programming without mutation and the different aspects of a programming language.
 </p>
 <p>
  Overall, that is a lot, especially since all the quoted terms above are not intended to make sense before going through the lectures.  So please work through the material methodically and carefully -- skimming things is likely to cause more grief than time savings.  Our goal is to build a perspective and terminology that will allow us to build carefully, precisely, and efficiently toward a rich set of concepts that are beautiful in themselves and crucial for the upcoming modules.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will need most or all of the videos to do the homework because  it helps to understand functions, pairs, lists, and let-expressions before we can write very many interesting programs.  So do the lectures first, trying out your own variations of the code presented in the videos, doing the in-video quizzes, and otherwise making sure you "understand what's going on".  Then approach the programming assignment, which is divided into 11 separate problems, but they are inter-related, so best done together.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the videos and homework, as in all the course modules, there are other resources.  At the top of the module are reading notes that go over the same material as the lectures as well as downloadable files with the slides and code in the videos. At the bottom of the module are practice problems, hints, and other resources contributed by past community mentors.
